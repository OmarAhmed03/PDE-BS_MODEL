# Option Pricing Modeling and Analysis with Black-Scholes Equation and ANN 

**Exploring option pricing methodologies through a deep learning approach and comparing it with the classic Black-Scholes model.**

## Overview

[Insert a visually engaging image or animation showcasing option pricing concepts or models]

This project delves into the realm of option pricing by combining the traditional Black-Scholes model with the power of artificial neural networks (ANNs). It aims to:

* Develop an ANN model for option price prediction.
* Conduct a comparative analysis between the ANN model and the Black-Scholes model.
* Construct a web application for practical price prediction.

## Key Components

**1. Data Collection and Analysis**

* **Dataset:**
    * Source: Yahoo Finance API
    * Location: `Dataset` folder
